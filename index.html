         <div class="post-content">
           <p>The cybersecurity intelligence firm Cyble which is specialized in finding data breaches found that 267 million Facebook profiles data are being sold on the dark web for 500 Euros

Facebook is the largest social networking site in the world, with more than 2.5 billion active users every month. Hence, we can quickly think that if the company of this size meets any data breach, then definitely everyone loses along with the company.

Few days ago, Cyble also reported about half a million Zoom accounts that are being sold on the dark web. Today is another one of those days when the personal data of millions of Facebook users is put at risk.</p>

         <div class="post-content">
           <p>Microsoft has patched a worm-like vulnerability in its Teams workplace video chat and collaboration platform that could have allowed attackers to take over an organization's entire roster of Teams accounts just by sending participants a malicious link to an innocent-looking image.

The flaw, impacting both desktop and web versions of the app, was discovered by cybersecurity researchers at CyberArk. After the findings were responsibly disclosed on March 23, Microsoft patched the vulnerability in an update released on April 20.

"Even if an attacker doesn't gather much information from a Teams' account, they could still use the account to traverse throughout an organization (just like a worm)," CyberArk's Omer Tsarfati said.

"Eventually, the attacker could access all the data from your organization's Teams accounts — gathering confidential information, meetings and calendar information, competitive data, secrets, passwords, private information, business plans, etc."</p>

         <h3 class="post-title">U.S. Offers Rewards up to $5 Million for Information on North Korean Hackers</h3>
         <div class="post-content">
           <p>The United States agencies today released a joint advisory warning the world about the 'significant cyber threat' posed by North Korean state-sponsored hackers to the global banking and financial institutions.

Besides a summary of recent cyberattacks attributed to North Korean hackers, the advisory—issued by U.S. Departments of State, the Treasury, and Homeland Security, and the FBI—also contains a comprehensive guide intends to help the international community, industries, and other governments defend against North Korea's illicit activities.

"In particular, the United States is deeply concerned about North Korea's malicious cyber activities, which the U.S. government refers to as HIDDEN COBRA. The DPRK has the capability to conduct disruptive or destructive cyber activities affecting U.S. critical infrastructure," the advisory says.

"The DPRK also uses cyber capabilities to steal from financial institutions, and has demonstrated a pattern of disruptive and harmful cyber activity that is wholly inconsistent with the growing international consensus on what constitutes responsible state behavior in cyberspace."

Notably, it also mentioned that the U.S. government is now offering a monetary reward of up to $5 million to anyone who can share 'information about illicit North Korea's activities in cyberspace,' including past or ongoing hacking operations.</p>

         <h3 class="post-title">Hackers Targeting Critical Healthcare Facilities With Ransomware During Coronavirus Pandemic</h3>
         <div class="post-content">
           <p>As hospitals around the world are struggling to respond to the coronavirus crisis, cybercriminals—with no conscience and empathy—are continuously targeting healthcare organizations, research facilities, and other governmental organizations with ransomware and malicious information stealers.

The new research, published by Palo Alto Networks and shared with The Hacker News, confirmed that "the threat actors who profit from cybercrime will go to any extent, including targeting organizations that are in the front lines and responding to the pandemic on a daily basis."

While the security firm didn't name the latest victims, it said a Canadian government healthcare organization and a Canadian medical research university both suffered ransomware attacks, as criminal groups seek to exploit the crisis for financial gain.

The attacks were detected between March 24 and March 26 and were initiated as part of the coronavirus-themed phishing campaigns that have become widespread in recent months.

Palo Alto Networks' disclosure comes as The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), biotechnology firm 10x Genomics, Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic, and Hammersmith Medicines Research have been hit by cyberattacks in the past few weeks.</p>
